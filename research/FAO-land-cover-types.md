3. Water Bodies (code #3) - At least 60% of area is covered by permanent water bodies.
4. Dense Forests (code #10) Tree cover >60% (canopy >2m).
5. Open Forests (code #20) - Tree cover 10-60% (canopy >2m).
6. Woody Wetlands (code #27) - Shrub and tree cover >10% (>1m). Permanently or seasonally inundated
