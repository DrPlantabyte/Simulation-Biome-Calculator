[Seamap Australia](https://seamapaustralia.org/classification/) has multiple systems of a very detailed, tiered classification for marine waters. Their simplest is the NSW Marine Habitats 2002 system, which has 9 near-shore and intertidal categories:

1. Seawall
2. Island and rocks
3. Reef and shoal
4. Rocky intertidal
5. Beach
6. Subtidal sand
7. Seagrass
8. Mangrove
9. Saltmarsh

The NSW Ocean Ecosystems classification divides the ocean by depth, with the above zones only occuring in the first two zones:
* 0-20m
* 20-60m
* 60-200m
* 200+m

Thus at a coarser spatial scale, a resonal simplification might be:
* Reef and shoal
* Rock and sand
* Seagrass and seaweed forest
* Mangrove and saltmarsh
